\fP
.fi

Available options:

After changing the filters (\fBskip_file\fP or \fBskip_dir\fP in your configs) you must
execute \fBonedrive --synchronize --resync\fP.

.SH FIRST RUN

After installing the application you must run it at least once from the terminal
to authorize it.

You will be asked to open a specific link using your web browser where you
will have to login into your Microsoft Account and give the application the
permission to access your files. After giving the permission, you will be
redirected to a blank page. Copy the URI of the blank page into the application.


.SH SYSTEMD INTEGRATION

Service files are installed into user and system directories.
.TP
OneDrive service running as root user
To enable this mode, run as root user
.nf
\fB
systemctl enable onedrive
systemctl start onedrive
\fP
.fi

.TP
OneDrive service running as root user for a non-root user
This mode allows starting the OneDrive service automatically with
system start for multiple users. For each \fB<username>\fP run:
.nf
\fB
systemctl enable onedrive@<username>
systemctl start onedrive@<username>
\fP
.fi

.TP
OneDrive service running as non-root user
In this mode the service will be started when the user logs in.
Run as user
.nf
\fB
systemctl --user enable onedrive
systemctl --user start onedrive
\fP
.fi

.SH LOGGING OUTPUT

When running onedrive all actions can be logged to a separate log file.
This can be enabled by using the \fB--enable-logging\fP flag.
By default, log files will be written to \fB/var/log/onedrive\fP.

All logfiles will be in the format of \fB%username%.onedrive.log\fP,
where \fB%username%\fP represents the user who ran the client.


.SH NOTIFICATIONS

If OneDrive has been compiled with support for notifications, a running
\fBonedrive\fP in monitor mode will send notifications about
initialization and errors via libnotify to the dbus.

Note that this does not work if \fBonedrive\fP is started as root
for a user via the \fBonedrive@<username>\fP service.
