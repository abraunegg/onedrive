.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a free Microsoft OneDrive Client designed to work with OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business, Office365 OneDrive, and SharePoint Libraries. It's fully compatible with most major Linux distributions and FreeBSD, and can be containerised using Docker or Podman. The client offers secure one-way and two-way synchronisation capabilities, making it easy to connect to Microsoft OneDrive services across various platforms.

.SH CONFIGURATION
By default, the client will use a sensible set of default values to interact with the Microsoft OneDrive service.
.TP
Should you wish to change these defaults, you should copy the default config file into your home directory before making any applicable changes:

.nf
\fB
mkdir\ \-p\ ~/.config/onedrive
cp\ @DOCDIR@/config\ ~/.config/onedrive/config
\fP
.fi

.TP
Please refer to the online documentation file application-config-options.md for details on all configuration file options.

.SH CLIENT SIDE FILTERING
Client Side Filtering in the context of the OneDrive Client for Linux refers to user-configured rules that determine what files and directories the client should upload or download from Microsoft OneDrive. These rules are crucial for optimising synchronisation, especially when dealing with large numbers of files or specific file types. The OneDrive Client for Linux offers several configuration options to facilitate this:
.TP
.B skip_dir
Specifies directories that should not be synchronised with OneDrive. Useful for omitting large or irrelevant directories from the sync process.
.TP
.B skip_dotfiles
Excludes dotfiles, usually configuration files or scripts, from the sync. Ideal for users who prefer to keep these files local.
.TP
.B skip_file
Allows specifying specific files to exclude from synchronisation. Offers flexibility in selecting essential files for cloud storage.
.TP
.B skip_symlinks
Prevents symlinks, which often point to files outside the OneDrive directory or to irrelevant locations, from being included in the sync.
.PP
Additionally, the OneDrive Client for Linux allows the implementation of Client Side Filtering rules through a 'sync_list' file. This file explicitly states which directories or files should be included in the synchronisation. By default, any item not listed in the 'sync_list' file is excluded. This approach offers granular control over synchronisation, ensuring that only necessary data is transferred to and from Microsoft OneDrive.
.PP
These configurable options and the 'sync_list' file provide users with the flexibility to tailor the synchronisation process to their specific needs, conserving bandwidth and storage space while ensuring that important files are always backed up and accessible.
.TP
.B NOTE:
After changing any Client Side Filtering rule, a full re-synchronisation must be performed using --resync

.SH FIRST RUN
Once you've installed the application, you'll need to authorise it using your Microsoft OneDrive Account. This can be done by simply running the application without any additional command switches.
.TP
Please be aware that some companies may require you to explicitly add this app to the Microsoft MyApps portal. To add an approved app to your apps, click on the ellipsis in the top-right corner and select "Request new apps." On the next page, you can add this app. If it's not listed, you should make a request through your IT department.
.TP
When you run the application for the first time, you'll be prompted to open a specific URL using your web browser, where you'll need to log in to your Microsoft Account and grant the application permission to access your files. After granting permission to the application, you'll be redirected to a blank page. Simply copy the URI from the blank page and paste it into the application.
.TP
This process authenticates your application with your account information, and it is now ready to use to sync your data between your local system and Microsoft OneDrive.

.SH GUI NOTIFICATIONS
If the client has been compiled with support for notifications, the client will send notifications about client activity via libnotify to the GUI via DBus when the client is being run in --monitor mode.

.SH APPLICATION LOGGING
When running onedrive all actions can be logged to a separate log file. This can be enabled by using the \fB--enable-logging\fP flag. By default, log files will be written to \fB/var/log/onedrive\fP. All logfiles will be in the format of \fB%username%.onedrive.log\fP, where \fB%username%\fP represents the user who ran the client.

.SH ALL CLI OPTIONS
The options below allow you to control the behavior of the onedrive client from the CLI. Without any specific option, if the client is already authenticated, the client will exit without any further action.
