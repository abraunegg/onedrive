## Known Issues with Installing from the above packages

### 1. The 'onedrive' client will automatically startup post 'authentication' without any further actions.
The 'onedrive' client will automatically startup post 'authentication' without any further actions. In some circumstances this may be highly undesirable and can also lead to data loss.

This is because, when the package is installed, the following symbolic link is created:
```text
Created symlink /etc/systemd/user/default.target.wants/onedrive.service → /usr/lib/systemd/user/onedrive.service.
```

This issue is being tracked by: [#1274](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/issues/1274)

**Important:** It is highly advisable that you remove this symbolic link before you configure or authenticate your client. If you do not remove this symbolic link before you configure or authenticate your client this could lead to multiple copies of the client running, leading to sync conflics and operational issues which may include data loss (data deleted locally & on OneDrive).

Do not rely on this symbolic link for your systemd configuration to automatically start your onedrive client - refer to [Running 'onedrive' as a system service](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md#running-onedrive-as-a-system-service) on how to configure this correctly.


### 2. The client will segfault | core-dump when exiting
When the client is being run in `--monitor` mode manually, or when using the systemd service, the client will segfault on exit.

This issue is caused by the way the Ubuntu 'onedrive' packages are built using the Ubuntu LDC package & compiler options which is the root cause for this issue. Refer to: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ldc/+bug/1895969

*  https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/issues/1609

**Resolution Options:**
*  Uninstall the package and build client from source
