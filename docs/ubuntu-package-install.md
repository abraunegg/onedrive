# Installation of 'onedrive' package on Debian and Ubuntu

This document covers the appropriate steps to install the 'onedrive' client using the provided packages for Debian and Ubuntu.

#### Important information for all Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distribution users:
This information is specifically for the following platforms and distributions:

*   Lubuntu
*   Linux Mint
*   POP OS
*   Peppermint OS
*   Raspbian
*   Ubuntu

Whilst there are [onedrive](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=onedrive&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all) Universe packages available for Ubuntu, do not install 'onedrive' from these Universe packages. The default Ubuntu Universe packages are out-of-date and are not supported and should not be used.

## Determine which instructions to use
Ubuntu and its clones are based on various different releases, thus, you must use the correct instructions below, otherwise you may run into package dependancy issues and will be unable to install the client.

### Step 1: Remove any configured PPA and associated 'onedrive' package
Many Internet 'help' pages provide inconsistent details on how to install the OneDrive Client for Linux. A number of these continue to point users to install the client via a PPA repository. As this PPA repository is linked to the Debian packages, it is only updated when the Debian packages are updated. As such, it is not advisable to install from this PPA repository.

To remove the PPA repository and the older client, perform the following actions:
```text
sudo apt remove onedrive
sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:yann1ck/onedrive
```

### Step 2: Ensure your system is up-to-date
Use a script, similar to the following to ensure your system is updated correctly:
```text
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/lock
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get dist-upgrade -y
apt-get autoremove -y
apt-get autoclean -y
```

Run this script as 'root' by using `su -` to elevate to 'root'. Example below:
```text
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-48-generic x86_64)

## Known Issues with Installing from the above packages

### 1. The 'onedrive' client will automatically startup post 'authentication' without any further actions.
The 'onedrive' client will automatically startup post 'authentication' without any further actions. In some circumstances this may be highly undesirable and can also lead to data loss.

This is because, when the package is installed, the following symbolic link is created:
```text
Created symlink /etc/systemd/user/default.target.wants/onedrive.service → /usr/lib/systemd/user/onedrive.service.
```

To resolve this, so that the client is *not* automatically started, without 'enabling' the client yourself, you need to remove this symbolic link:
```
sudo rm /etc/systemd/user/default.target.wants/onedrive.service
```

This issue is being tracked by: [#1274](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/issues/1274)

**Important:** It is highly advisable that you remove this symbolic link before you configure or authenticate your client. If you do not remove this symbolic link before you configure or authenticate your client this will be a major contributor to why the following error message will be generated:
```
ERROR: onedrive application is already running - check system process list for active application instances
```

**Important:** Do not rely on this symbolic link for your systemd configuration to automatically start your onedrive client - refer to [Running 'onedrive' as a system service](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md#running-onedrive-as-a-system-service) on how to configure this correctly.

### 2. The client will segfault | core-dump when exiting
When the client is being run in `--monitor` mode manually, or when using the systemd service, the client will segfault on exit.

This issue is caused by the way the Ubuntu 'onedrive' packages are built using the Ubuntu LDC package & compiler options which is the root cause for this issue. Refer to: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ldc/+bug/1895969

**Additional references:**
*  https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/issues/1053
*  https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/issues/1609

**Resolution Options:**
*  Uninstall the package and build client from source
