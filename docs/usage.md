## Important Notes

### Memory Usage
Starting with version 2.5.x, the application has been completely rewritten. It is crucial to understand the memory requirements to ensure the application runs smoothly on your system.

During a `--resync` or full online scan, the OneDrive Client may use approximately 1GB of memory for every 100,000 objects stored online. This is because the client retrieves data for all objects via the OneDrive API before processing them locally. Once this process completes, the memory is freed. To avoid performance issues, ensure your system has sufficient available memory. If the system starts using swap space due to insufficient free memory, this can significantly slow down the application and impact overall performance.

To avoid potential system instability or the client being terminated by your Out-Of-Memory (OOM) process monitors, please ensure your system has sufficient memory allocated or configure adequate swap space.

### Upgrading from the 'skilion' Client
The 'skilion' version has a significant number of issues in how it manages the local sync state. When upgrading from the 'skilion' client to this client, it's recommended to stop any service or OneDrive process that may be running. Once all OneDrive services are stopped, make sure to remove any old client binaries from your system.

### Guidelines for Local File and Folder Naming in the Synchronisation Directory
To ensure seamless synchronisation with Microsoft OneDrive, it's critical to adhere strictly to the prescribed naming conventions for your files and folders within the sync directory. The guidelines detailed below are designed to preempt potential sync failures by aligning with Microsoft Windows Naming Conventions, coupled with specific OneDrive restrictions.

> [!WARNING]
> Failure to comply will result in synchronisation being bypassed for the offending files or folders, necessitating a rename of the local item to establish sync compatibility.

#### Key Restrictions and Limitations
* Invalid Characters: 
  * Avoid using the following characters in names of files and folders: `" * : < > ? / \ |`
  * Names should not start or end with spaces
  * Names should not end with a fullstop / period character `.`
* Prohibited Names: 
  * Certain names are reserved and cannot be used for files or folders: `.lock`, `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM0 - COM9`, `LPT0 - LPT9`, `desktop.ini`, any filename starting with `~$`
  * The text sequence `_vti_` cannot appear anywhere in a file or directory name
  * A file and folder called `forms` is unsupported at the root level of a synchronisation directory
* Path Length
  * All files and folders stored in your 'sync_dir' (typically `~/OneDrive`) must not have a path length greater than:
    * 400 characters for OneDrive Business & SharePoint
    * 430 characters for OneDrive Personal

Should a file or folder infringe upon these naming conventions or restrictions, synchronisation will skip the item, indicating an invalid name according to Microsoft Naming Convention. The only remedy is to rename the offending item. This constraint is by design and remains firm.

> [!TIP]
> The UTF-16 character set provides a capability to use alternative characters to work around the restrictions and limitations imposed by Microsoft OneDrive. An example of some replacement characters are below:
> | Standard Invalid Character | Potential UTF-16 Replacement Character |
> |--------------------|------------------------------|
> | .                  | ․ (One Dot Leader, `\u2024`)  |
> | :                  | ː (Modifier Letter Triangular Colon, `\u02D0`) |
> | \|                 | │ (Box Drawings Light Vertical, `\u2502`)       |

> [!CAUTION]
> The last critically important point is that Microsoft OneDrive does not adhere to POSIX standards, which fundamentally impacts naming conventions. In Unix environments (which are POSIX compliant), files and folders can exist simultaneously with identical names if their capitalisation differs. **This is not possible on Microsoft OneDrive.** If such a scenario occurs, the OneDrive Client for Linux will encounter a conflict, preventing the synchronisation of the conflicting file or folder. This constraint is a conscious design choice and is immutable. To avoid synchronisation issues, preemptive renaming of any conflicting local files or folders is advised.

#### Further reading:
The above guidelines are essential for maintaining synchronisation integrity with Microsoft OneDrive. Adhering to them ensures your files and folders sync without issue. For additional details, consult the following resources:
* [Microsoft Windows Naming Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file)
* [Restrictions and limitations in OneDrive and SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa)

**Adherence to these guidelines is not optional but mandatory to avoid sync disruptions.**

### Support for Microsoft Azure Information Protected Files
> [!CAUTION]
> If you are using OneDrive Business Accounts and your organisation implements Azure Information Protection, these AIP files will report as one size & hash online, but when downloaded, will report a totally different size and hash. 
>
> By default these files will fail integrity checking and be deleted locally, meaning that AIP files will not reside on your platform. These AIP files will be flagged as a failed download.
> 
> If you chose to enable `--disable-download-validation` , the AIP files will download to your platform, however, if there are any other genuine download failures where the size and hash are different, these too will be retained locally meaning you may experience data integrity loss. This is due to the Microsoft Graph API lacking any capability to identify up-front that a file utilises AIP, thus zero capability to differentiate between AIP and non-AIP files for failure.
> 
> Please use the `--disable-download-validation` option with extreme caution and understand the risk if you enable it.

### Compatibility with curl
If your system uses curl < 7.47.0, curl will default to HTTP/1.1 for HTTPS operations, and the client will follow suit, using HTTP/1.1.

For systems running curl >= 7.47.0 and < 7.62.0, curl will prefer HTTP/2 for HTTPS, but it will still use HTTP/1.1 as the default for these operations. The client will employ HTTP/1.1 for HTTPS operations as well.

However, if your system employs curl >= 7.62.0, curl will, by default, prioritise HTTP/2 over HTTP/1.1. In this case, the client will utilise HTTP/2 for most HTTPS operations and stick with HTTP/1.1 for others. Please note that this distinction is governed by the OneDrive platform, not our client.

If you explicitly want to use HTTP/1.1, you can do so by using the `--force-http-11` flag or setting the configuration option `force_http_11 = "true"`. This will compel the application to exclusively use HTTP/1.1. Otherwise, all client operations will align with the curl default settings for your distribution.

#### Known curl bugs that impact the use of this client

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your distribution provides one of these curl versions you must upgrade your curl version to the latest available, or get your distribution to provide a more modern version of curl. Refer to [curl releases](https://curl.se/docs/releases.html) for curl version information.
>
> If you are using one of the above curl versions, the following application message will be generated:
> ```text
> WARNING: Your curl/libcurl version (curl.version.number) has known HTTP/2 bugs that impact the use of this application.
>          Please report this to your distribution and request that they provide a newer curl version for your platform or upgrade this yourself.
>          Downgrading all application operations to use HTTP/1.1 to ensure maximum operational stability.
>          Please read https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/usage.md#compatibility-with-curl for more information.
> ```
> If you are unable to upgrade your version of curl, you must add the following to your config file:
> ```text
> force_http_11 = "true"
> ip_protocol_version = "1"
> ```
> When these two options are applied to your application configuration, the following application message will be generated:
> ```text
> WARNING: Your curl/libcurl version (curl.version.number) has known operational bugs that impact the use of this application.
>          Please report this to your distribution and request that they provide a newer curl version for your platform or upgrade this yourself.
> ```
> In both cases, the WARNING line will be sent to the GUI for notification purposes if notifications have been enabled. To avoid this message and/or the GUI notification your only path of remediation is to upgrade your curl version on your platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are significant HTTP/2 bugs in all curl versions < 8.6.x that can lead to HTTP/2 errors such as `Error in the HTTP2 framing layer on handle` or `Stream error in the HTTP/2 framing layer on handle`
>
> The only options to resolve this are the following:
> 1. Upgrade your curl version to the latest available, or get your distribution to provide a more modern version of curl. Refer to [curl releases](https://curl.se/docs/releases.html) for curl version information.
> 2. Configure the client to only use HTTP/1.1 via the config option `--force-http-11` flag or setting the configuration option `force_http_11 = "true"`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It has been evidenced that curl has an internal DNS resolution bug that at random times will skip using IPv4 for DNS resolution and only uses IPv6 DNS resolution when the host system is configured to use IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
> 
> As a result of this curl resolution bug, if your system does not have an IPv6 DNS resolver, and/or does not have a valid IPv6 network path to Microsoft OneDrive, you may encounter these errors: 
> 
> * `A libcurl timeout has been triggered - data transfer too slow, no DNS resolution response, no server response`
> * `Could not connect to server on handle ABC12DEF3456`
>
> The only options to resolve this are the following:
> 1. Implement and/or ensure that IPv6 DNS resolution is possible on your system; allow IPv6 network connectivity between your system and Microsoft OneDrive
> 2. Configure the client to only use IPv4 DNS resolution via setting the configuration option `ip_protocol_version = "1"`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using Debian 12 or Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE) 6, you can install curl version 8.10.1 from the respective backports repositories to address the bugs present in the default curl version.


## First Steps
### Authorise the Application with Your Microsoft OneDrive Account
Once you've installed the application, you'll need to authorise it using your Microsoft OneDrive Account. This can be done by simply running the application without any additional command switches.

Please be aware that some companies may require you to explicitly add this app to the [Microsoft MyApps portal](https://myapps.microsoft.com/). To add an approved app to your apps, click on the ellipsis in the top-right corner and select "Request new apps." On the next page, you can add this app. If it's not listed, you should make a request through your IT department.

When you run the application for the first time, you'll be prompted to open a specific URL using your web browser, where you'll need to log in to your Microsoft Account and grant the application permission to access your files. After granting permission to the application, you'll be redirected to a blank page. Simply copy the URI from the blank page and paste it into the application.

**Example:**
```text
[user@hostname ~]$ onedrive
Authorise this app by visiting:

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorise?client_id=22c49a0d-d21c-4792-aed1-8f163c982546&scope=Files.ReadWrite%20Files.ReadWrite.all%20Sites.ReadWrite.All%20offline_access&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient

Enter the response URI from your browser:  https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient?code=<redacted>

The application has been successfully authorised, but no additional command switches were provided.

Please use 'onedrive --help' for further assistance on how to run this application.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Without additional input or configuration, the OneDrive Client for Linux will automatically adhere to default application settings during synchronisation processes with Microsoft OneDrive.

### Display Your Applicable Runtime Configuration
To verify the configuration that the application will use, use the following command:
```text
onedrive --display-config
```
This command will display all the relevant runtime interpretations of the options and configurations you are using. An example output is as follows:
```text
Reading configuration file: /home/user/.config/onedrive/config
Configuration file successfully loaded
onedrive version                             = vX.Y.Z-A-bcdefghi
Config path                                  = /home/user/.config/onedrive
Config file found in config path             = true
Config option 'drive_id'                     = 
Config option 'sync_dir'                     = ~/OneDrive
...
Config option 'webhook_enabled'              = false
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using multiple OneDrive accounts, it's essential to always use the `--confdir` command followed by the appropriate configuration directory. This ensures that the specific configuration you intend to view is correctly displayed.

### Understanding OneDrive Client for Linux Operational Modes
There are two modes of operation when using the client:
1. Standalone sync mode that performs a single sync action against Microsoft OneDrive.
2. Ongoing sync mode that continuously syncs your data with Microsoft OneDrive.

> [!TIP]
> To understand further the client operational modes and how the client operates, please review the [client architecture](client-architecture.md) documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The default setting for the OneDrive Client on Linux will sync all data from your Microsoft OneDrive account to your local device. To avoid this and select specific items for synchronisation, you should explore setting up 'Client Side Filtering' rules. This will help you manage and specify what exactly gets synced with your Microsoft OneDrive account.

#### Standalone Synchronisation Operational Mode (Standalone Mode)
This method of use can be employed by issuing the following option to the client:
```text
onedrive --sync
```
For simplicity, this can be shortened to the following:
```text
onedrive -s
```

#### Ongoing Synchronisation Operational Mode (Monitor Mode)
This method of use can be utilised by issuing the following option to the client:
```text
onedrive --monitor
```
For simplicity, this can be shortened to the following:
```text
onedrive -m
```
> [!NOTE]
> This method of use is used when enabling a systemd service to run the application in the background.

Two common errors can occur when using monitor mode:
*   Initialisation failure
*   Unable to add a new inotify watch

Both of these errors are local environment issues, where the following system variables need to be increased as the current system values are potentially too low:
*   `fs.file-max`
*   `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`

To determine what the existing values are on your system, use the following commands:
```text
sysctl fs.file-max
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches
```
Alternatively, when running the client with increased verbosity (see below), the client will display what the current configured system maximum values are:
```text
...
All application operations will be performed in: /home/user/OneDrive
OneDrive synchronisation interval (seconds): 300
Maximum allowed open files:                 393370   <-- This is the current operating system fs.file-max value
Maximum allowed inotify watches:            29374    <-- This is the current operating system fs.inotify.max_user_watches value
Initialising filesystem inotify monitoring ...
...
```
To determine what value to change to, you need to count all the files and folders in your configured 'sync_dir':
```text
cd /path/to/your/sync/dir
ls -laR | wc -l
```

To make a change to these variables using your file and folder count, use the following process:
```text
sudo sysctl fs.file-max=<new_value>
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=<new_value>
```
Once these values are changed, you will need to restart your client so that the new values are detected and used.

To make these changes permanent on your system, refer to your OS reference documentation.

## Using the OneDrive Client for Linux to synchronise your data

### Increasing application logging level
When running a sync (`--sync`) or using monitor mode (`--monitor`), it may be desirable to see additional information regarding the progress and operation of the client. For example, for a `--sync` command, this would be:
```text
onedrive --sync --verbose
```
Furthermore, for simplicity, this can be simplified to the following:
```
onedrive -s -v
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adding `--verbose` twice will enable debug logging output. This is generally required when raising a bug report or needing to understand a problem.

### Using 'Client Side Filtering' rules to determine what should be synced with Microsoft OneDrive
Client Side Filtering in the context of the OneDrive Client for Linux refers to user-configured rules that determine what files and directories the client should upload or download from Microsoft OneDrive. These rules are crucial for optimising synchronisation, especially when dealing with large numbers of files or specific file types. The OneDrive Client for Linux offers several configuration options to facilitate this:

* **check_nosync:** This option allows you to create a `.nosync` file in local directories, to skip that directory from being included in sync operations.
* **skip_dir:** This option allows the user to specify directories that should not be synchronised with OneDrive. It's particularly useful for omitting large or irrelevant directories from the sync process.
* **skip_dotfiles:** Dotfiles, usually configuration files or scripts, can be excluded from the sync. This is useful for users who prefer to keep these files local.
* **skip_file:** Specific files can be excluded from synchronisation using this option. It provides flexibility in selecting which files are essential for cloud storage.
* **skip_size:** Skip files greater than this specific size (in MB)
* **skip_symlinks:** Symlinks often point to files outside the OneDrive directory or to locations that are not relevant for cloud storage. This option prevents them from being included in the sync.

Additionally, the OneDrive Client for Linux allows the implementation of Client Side Filtering rules through a 'sync_list' file. This file explicitly states which directories or files should be included in the synchronisation. By default, any item not listed in the 'sync_list' file is excluded. This method offers a more granular approach to synchronisation, ensuring that only the necessary data is transferred to and from Microsoft OneDrive.

These configurable options and the 'sync_list' file provide users with the flexibility to tailor the synchronisation process to their specific needs, conserving bandwidth and storage space while ensuring that important files are always backed up and accessible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Client Side Filtering rules are generally processed in the following order:
> 1. 'check_nosync'
> 2. 'skip_dotfiles'
> 3. 'skip_symlinks'
> 4. 'skip_dir'
> 5. 'skip_file'
> 6. 'sync_list'
> 7. 'skip_size'
>
> This can be best illustrated below:
> 
> ![Client Side Filtering Processing Order](./puml/client_side_filtering_processing_order.png)
>
> For further details please review the [client architecture](client-architecture.md) documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After changing any Client Side Filtering rule, you must perform a full re-synchronisation by using `--resync`.

### Testing your configuration
You can test your configuration by utilising the `--dry-run` CLI option. No files will be downloaded, uploaded, or removed; however, the application will display what 'would' have occurred. For example:
```text
onedrive --sync --verbose --dry-run
Reading configuration file: /home/user/.config/onedrive/config
Configuration file successfully loaded
Using 'user' Config Dir: /home/user/.config/onedrive
DRY-RUN Configured. Output below shows what 'would' have occurred.
DRY-RUN: Copying items.sqlite3 to items-dryrun.sqlite3 to use for dry run operations
DRY RUN: Not creating backup config file as --dry-run has been used
DRY RUN: Not updating hash files as --dry-run has been used

### Performing a sync with Microsoft OneDrive
By default, all files are downloaded in `~/OneDrive`. This download location is controlled by the 'sync_dir' config option.

After authorising the application, a sync of your data can be performed by running:
```text
onedrive --sync
```
This will synchronise files from your Microsoft OneDrive account to your `~/OneDrive` local directory or to your specified 'sync_dir' location.

> [!TIP]
> If you prefer to use your local files as stored in `~/OneDrive` as your 'source of truth,' use the following sync command:
> ```text
> onedrive --sync --local-first
> ```

### Performing a single directory synchronisation with Microsoft OneDrive
In some cases, it may be desirable to synchronise a single directory under ~/OneDrive without having to change your client configuration. To do this, use the following command:
```text
onedrive --sync --single-directory '<dir_name>'
```

> [!TIP]
> If the full path is `~/OneDrive/mydir`, the command would be `onedrive --sync --single-directory 'mydir'`

### Performing a 'one-way' download synchronisation with Microsoft OneDrive
In some cases, it may be desirable to 'download only' from Microsoft OneDrive. To do this, use the following command:
```text
onedrive --sync --download-only
```
This will download all the content from Microsoft OneDrive to your `~/OneDrive` location. Any files that are deleted online will remain locally and will not be removed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is an application functionality change between v2.4.x and v.2.5x when using this option.
>
> In prior v2.4.x releases, online deletes were automatically processed, thus automatically deleting local files that were deleted online, however there was zero way to perform a `--download-only` operation to archive the online state.
>
> In v2.5.x and above, when using `--download-only` the default is that all files will remain locally as an archive of your online data rather than being deleted locally if deleted online.

> [!TIP]
> If you have the requirement to clean up local files that have been removed online, use the following command:
> ```text
> onedrive --sync --download-only --cleanup-local-files
> ```

### Performing a 'one-way' upload synchronisation with Microsoft OneDrive
In certain scenarios, you might need to perform an 'upload only' operation to Microsoft OneDrive. This means that you'll be uploading data to OneDrive, but not synchronising any changes or additions made elsewhere. Use this command to initiate an upload-only synchronisation:

```text
onedrive --sync --upload-only
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The 'upload only' mode operates independently of OneDrive's online content. It doesn't check or sync with what's already stored on OneDrive. It only uploads data from the local client.
> - If a local file or folder that was previously synchronised with Microsoft OneDrive is now missing locally, it will be deleted from OneDrive during this operation.

> [!TIP]
> If you have the requirement to ensure that all data on Microsoft OneDrive remains intact (e.g., preventing deletion of items on OneDrive if they're deleted locally), use this command instead:
> ```text
> onedrive --sync --upload-only --no-remote-delete
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - `--upload-only`: This command will only upload local changes to OneDrive. These changes can include additions, modifications, moves, and deletions of files and folders.
> - `--no-remote-delete`: Adding this command prevents the deletion of any items on OneDrive, even if they're deleted locally. This creates a one-way archive on OneDrive where files are only added and never removed.

### Performing a selective synchronisation via 'sync_list' file
Selective synchronisation allows you to sync only specific files and directories.
To enable selective synchronisation, create a file named `sync_list` in your application configuration directory (default is `~/.config/onedrive`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Important points to understand before using 'sync_list'.
> *    'sync_list' excludes _everything_ by default on OneDrive.
> *    'sync_list' follows an _"exclude overrides include"_ rule, and requires **explicit inclusion**.
> *    Order exclusions before inclusions, so that anything _specifically included_ is included.
> *    How and where you place your `/` matters for excludes and includes in subdirectories.

Each line of the 'sync_list' file represents a relative path from your `sync_dir`. All files and directories not matching any line of the file will be skipped during all operations. 

Additionally, the use of `/` is critically important to determine how a rule is interpreted. It is very similar to `**` wildcards, for those that are familiar with globbing patterns.
Here is an example of `sync_list`:
```text
# sync_list supports comments
#
# The ordering of entries is highly recommended - exclusions before inclusions
#
# Exclude temp folder(s) or file(s) under Documents folder(s), anywhere in OneDrive
!Documents/temp*
#
# Exclude secret data folder in root directory only
!/Secret_data/*
#
# Include everything else in root directory
# - Use 'sync_root_files' or --sync-root-files option
# Do not use /* as this will include everything including items you are expecting to be excluded
#
# Include my Backup folder(s) or file(s) anywhere on OneDrive
Backup
#
# Include my Backup folder in root
/Backup/
#
# Include Documents folder(s) anywhere in OneDrive
Documents/
#
# Include all PDF files in Documents folder(s), anywhere in OneDrive
Documents/*.pdf
#
# Include this single document in Documents folder(s), anywhere in OneDrive
Documents/latest_report.docx
#
# Include all Work/Project directories or files, inside 'Work' folder(s), anywhere in OneDrive
Work/Project*
#
# Include the 'Blog' directory, but exclude 'Parent' and any other children of the parent

```
The following are supported for pattern matching and exclusion rules:
*   Use the `*` to wildcard select any characters to match for the item to be included
*   Use either `!` or `-` characters at the start of the line to exclude an otherwise included item

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After changing the sync_list, you must perform a full re-synchronisation by adding `--resync` to your existing command line - for example: `onedrive --sync --resync`

> [!TIP]
> When enabling the use of 'sync_list,' utilise the `--display-config` option to validate that your configuration will be used by the application, and test your configuration by adding `--dry-run` to ensure the client will operate as per your requirement.

> [!TIP] 
> In some circumstances, it may be required to sync all the individual files within the 'sync_dir' root, but due to frequent name change / addition / deletion of these files, it is not desirable to constantly change the 'sync_list' file to include / exclude these files and force a resync. To assist with this, enable the following in your configuration file:
> ```text
> sync_root_files = "true"
> ```
> This will tell the application to sync any file that it finds in your 'sync_dir' root by default, negating the need to constantly update your 'sync_list' file.

### Performing a --resync
If you alter any of the subsequent configuration items, you will be required to execute a `--resync` to make sure your client is syncing your data with the updated configuration:
*   drive_id
*   sync_dir
*   skip_file
*   skip_dir
*   skip_dotfiles
*   skip_symlinks
*   sync_business_shared_items
*   Creating, Modifying or Deleting the 'sync_list' file

Additionally, you might opt for a `--resync` if you think it's necessary to ensure your data remains in sync. If you're using this switch simply because you're unsure of the sync status, you can check the actual sync status using `--display-sync-status`.

When you use `--resync`, you'll encounter the following warning and advice:
```text
Using --resync will delete your local 'onedrive' client state, so there won't be a record of your current 'sync status.'
This may potentially overwrite local versions of files with older versions downloaded from OneDrive, leading to local data loss.
If in doubt, back up your local data before using --resync.

Are you sure you want to proceed with --resync? [Y/N] 
```

To proceed with `--resync`, you must type 'y' or 'Y' to allow the application to continue.

> [!CAUTION] 
> It's highly recommended to use `--resync` only if the application prompts you to do so. Don't blindly set the application to start with `--resync` as your default option.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In certain automated environments (assuming you know what you're doing due to automation), to avoid the 'proceed with acknowledgement' requirement, add `--resync-auth` to automatically acknowledge the prompt.

### Performing a --force-sync without a --resync or changing your configuration
In some cases and situations, you may have configured the application to skip certain files and folders using 'skip_file' and 'skip_dir' configuration. You then may have a requirement to actually sync one of these items, but do not wish to modify your configuration, nor perform an entire `--resync` twice.

The `--force-sync` option allows you to sync a specific directory, ignoring your 'skip_file' and 'skip_dir' configuration and negating the requirement to perform a `--resync`.

To use this option, you must run the application manually in the following manner:
```text
onedrive --sync --single-directory '<directory_to_sync>' --force-sync <add any other options needed or required>
```

When using `--force-sync`, you'll encounter the following warning and advice:
```text
WARNING: Overriding application configuration to use application defaults for skip_dir and skip_file due to --sync --single-directory --force-sync being used

Using --force-sync will reconfigure the application to use defaults. This may have unknown future impacts.
By proceeding with this option, you accept any impacts, including potential data loss resulting from using --force-sync.

Are you sure you want to proceed with --force-sync [Y/N] 
```

To proceed with `--force-sync`, you must type 'y' or 'Y' to allow the application to continue.

### Enabling the Client Activity Log
When running onedrive, all actions can be logged to a separate log file. This can be enabled by using the `--enable-logging` flag or by adding `enable_logging = "true"` to your 'config' file.

By default, log files will be written to `/var/log/onedrive/` and will be in the format of `%username%.onedrive.log`, where `%username%` represents the user who ran the client to allow easy sorting of user to client activity log.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to ensure the existence of this directory and that your user has the applicable permissions to write to this directory; otherwise, the following error message will be printed:
> ```text
> ERROR: Unable to access /var/log/onedrive
> ERROR: Please manually create '/var/log/onedrive' and set appropriate permissions to allow write access
> ERROR: The requested client activity log will instead be located in your user's home directory
> ```

On many systems, ensuring that the log directory exists can be achieved by performing the following:
```text
sudo mkdir /var/log/onedrive
sudo chown root:users /var/log/onedrive
sudo chmod 0775 /var/log/onedrive
```

Additionally, you need to ensure that your user account is part of the 'users' group:
```
cat /etc/group | grep users
```

If your user is not part of this group, then you need to add your user to this group:
```
sudo usermod -a -G users <your-user-name>
```

If you need to make a group modification, you will need to 'logout' of all sessions / SSH sessions to log in again to have the new group access applied.

If the client is unable to write the client activity log, the following error message will be printed:
```text
ERROR: Unable to write the activity log to /var/log/onedrive/%username%.onedrive.log
ERROR: Please set appropriate permissions to allow write access to the logging directory for your user account
ERROR: The requested client activity log will instead be located in your user's home directory
```

If you receive this error message, you will need to diagnose why your system cannot write to the specified file location.

#### Client Activity Log Example:

#### Client Activity Log Differences
Despite application logging being enabled as early as possible, the following log entries will be missing from the client activity log when compared to console output:

**No user configuration file:**
```text
No user or system config file found, using application defaults
Using 'user' configuration path for application state data: /home/user/.config/onedrive
Using the following path to store the runtime application log: /var/log/onedrive
```
**User configuration file:**
```text
Reading configuration file: /home/user/.config/onedrive/config
Configuration file successfully loaded
Using 'user' configuration path for application state data: /home/user/.config/onedrive
Using the following path to store the runtime application log: /var/log/onedrive
```

### GUI Notifications
To enable GUI notifications, you must compile the application with GUI Notification Support. Refer to [GUI Notification Support](install.md#gui-notification-support) for details. Once compiled, GUI notifications will work by default in the display manager session under the following conditions:

* A D-Bus message bus daemon must be running.
* The environment variables XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS must be set.

Without these conditions met, GUI notifications will not function even if the support is compiled in.

Once these conditions have been met, the following application events will trigger a GUI notification within the display manager session by default:
*   Aborting a sync if .nosync file is found
*   Skipping a particular item due to an invalid name
*   Skipping a particular item due to an invalid symbolic link
*   Skipping a particular item due to an invalid UTF sequence
*   Skipping a particular item due to an invalid character encoding sequence
*   Cannot create remote directory
*   Cannot upload file changes (free space issue, breaches maximum allowed size, breaches maximum OneDrive Account path length)
*   Cannot delete remote file / folder
*   Cannot move remote file / folder
*   When a re-authentication is required
*   When a new client version is available
*   Files that fail to upload
*   Files that fail to download

Additionally, GUI notifications can also be sent for the following activities:
*   Successful file download
*   Successful file upload
*   Successful deletion locally (files and folders)
*   Successful deletion online (files and folders)

To enable these specific notifications, add the following to your 'config' file:
```
notify_file_actions = "true"
```

### Handling a Microsoft OneDrive Account Password Change
If you change your Microsoft OneDrive Account Password, the client will no longer be authorised to sync, and will generate the following error upon next application run:
```text
AADSTS50173: The provided grant has expired due to it being revoked, a fresh auth token is needed. The user might have changed or reset their password. The grant was issued on '<date-and-timestamp>' and the TokensValidFrom date (before which tokens are not valid) for this user is '<date-and-timestamp>'.

ERROR: You will need to issue a --reauth and re-authorise this client to obtain a fresh auth token.
```

To re-authorise the client, follow the steps below:
1.   If running the client as a system service (init.d or systemd), stop the applicable system service
2.   Run the command `onedrive --reauth`. This will clean up the previous authorisation, and will prompt you to re-authorise the client as per initial configuration. Please note, if you are using `--confdir` as part of your application runtime configuration, you must include this when telling the client to re-authenticate.
3.   Restart the client if running as a system service or perform the standalone sync operation again

The application will now sync with OneDrive with the new credentials.

### Determining the synchronisation result
When the client has finished syncing without errors, the following will be displayed:
```
Sync with Microsoft OneDrive is complete
```

If any items failed to sync, the following will be displayed:
```
Sync with Microsoft OneDrive has completed, however there are items that failed to sync.
```
A file list of failed upload or download items will also be listed to allow you to determine your next steps.

In order to fix the upload or download failures, you may need to:
*   Review the application output to determine what happened
*   Re-try your command utilising a resync to ensure your system is correctly synced with your Microsoft OneDrive Account

## Frequently Asked Configuration Questions

### How to change the default configuration of the client?
Configuration is determined by three layers, and applied in the following order:
*   Application default values
*   Values that are set in the configuration file
*   Values that are passed in via the command line at application runtime. These values will override any configuration file set value.

The default application values provide a reasonable operational default, and additional configuration is entirely optional.

If you want to change the application defaults, you can download a copy of the config file into your application configuration directory. Valid default directories for the config file are:
*   `~/.config/onedrive`
*   `/etc/onedrive`

> [!TIP] 
> To download a copy of the config file, use the following:
> ```text
> mkdir -p ~/.config/onedrive
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abraunegg/onedrive/master/config -O ~/.config/onedrive/config
> ```

For full configuration options and CLI switches, please refer to [application-config-options.md](application-config-options.md)

### How to change where my data from Microsoft OneDrive is stored?
By default, the location where your Microsoft OneDrive data is stored, is within your Home Directory under a directory called 'OneDrive'. This replicates as close as possible where the Microsoft Windows OneDrive client stores data.

To change this location, the application configuration option 'sync_dir' is used to specify a new local directory where your Microsoft OneDrive data should be stored.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Please be aware that if you designate a network mount point (such as NFS, Windows Network Share, or Samba Network Share) as your `sync_dir`, this setup inherently lacks 'inotify' support. Support for 'inotify' is essential for real-time tracking of file changes, which means that the client's 'Monitor Mode' cannot immediately detect changes in files located on these network shares. Instead, synchronisation between your local filesystem and Microsoft OneDrive will occur at intervals specified by the `monitor_interval` setting. This limitation regarding 'inotify' support on network mount points like NFS or Samba is beyond the control of this client.

### How to change what file and directory permissions are assigned to data that is downloaded from Microsoft OneDrive?
The following are the application default permissions for any new directory or file that is created locally when downloaded from Microsoft OneDrive:
*   Directories: 700 - This provides the following permissions: `drwx------`
*   Files: 600 - This provides the following permissions: `-rw-------`

These default permissions align to the security principal of 'least privilege' so that only you should have access to your data that you download from Microsoft OneDrive.

To alter these default permissions, you can adjust the values of two configuration options as follows. You can also use the [Unix Permissions Calculator](https://chmod-calculator.com/) to help you determine the necessary new permissions.
```text
sync_dir_permissions = "700"
sync_file_permissions = "600"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that special permission bits such as setuid, setgid, and the sticky bit are not supported. Valid permission values range from `000` to `777` only.

### How are uploads and downloads managed?
The system manages downloads and uploads using a multi-threaded approach. Specifically, the application utilises by default 8 threads (a maximum of 16 can be configured) for these processes. This thread count is preset and cannot be modified by users. This design ensures efficient handling of data transfers.

### How to only sync a specific directory?
There are two methods to achieve this:
*   Employ the '--single-directory' option to only sync this specific path
*   Employ 'sync_list' as part of your 'config' file to configure what files and directories to sync, and what should be excluded

### How to 'skip' files from syncing?
There are two methods to achieve this:
*   Employ 'skip_file' as part of your 'config' file to configure what files to skip
*   Employ 'sync_list' to configure what files and directories to sync, and what should be excluded

### How to 'skip' directories from syncing?
There are three methods available to 'skip' a directory from the sync process:
*   Employ 'skip_dir' as part of your 'config' file to configure what directories to skip
*   Employ 'sync_list' to configure what files and directories to sync, and what should be excluded
*   Employ 'check_nosync' as part of your 'config' file and a '.nosync' empty file within the directory to exclude to skip that directory

### How to 'skip' .files and .folders from syncing?
There are three methods to achieve this:
*   Employ 'skip_file' or 'skip_dir' to configure what files or folders to skip
*   Employ 'sync_list' to configure what files and directories to sync, and what should be excluded
*   Employ 'skip_dotfiles' as part of your 'config' file to skip any dot file (for example: `.Trash-1000` or `.xdg-volume-info`) from syncing to OneDrive

### How to 'skip' files larger than a certain size from syncing?
Use `skip_size = "value"` as part of your 'config' file where files larger than this size (in MB) will be skipped.

### How to 'rate limit' the application to control bandwidth consumed for upload & download operations?
To optimise Internet bandwidth usage during upload and download processes, include the 'rate_limit' setting in your configuration file. This setting controls the bandwidth allocated to each thread.

By default, 'rate_limit' is set to '0', indicating that the application will utilise the maximum available bandwidth across all threads.

To check the current 'rate_limit' value, use the `--display-config` command.

> [!NOTE]
> Since downloads and uploads are processed through multiple threads, the 'rate_limit' value applies to each thread separately. For instance, setting 'rate_limit' to 1048576 (1MB) means that during data transfers, the total bandwidth consumption might reach around 16MB, not just the 1MB configured due to the number of threads being used.

### How can I prevent my local disk from filling up?
By default, the application will reserve 50MB of disk space to prevent your filesystem from running out of disk space.

This default value can be modified by adding the 'space_reservation' configuration option and the applicable value as part of your 'config' file.

You can review the value being used when using `--display-config`.

### How does the client handle symbolic links?
Microsoft OneDrive has no concept or understanding of symbolic links, and attempting to upload a symbolic link to Microsoft OneDrive generates a platform API error. All data (files and folders) that are uploaded to OneDrive must be whole files or actual directories.

As such, there are only two methods to support symbolic links with this client:
1. Follow the Linux symbolic link and upload whatever the local symbolic link is pointing to to Microsoft OneDrive. This is the default behaviour.
2. Skip symbolic links by configuring the application to do so. When skipping, no data, no link, no reference is uploaded to OneDrive.

Use 'skip_symlinks' as part of your 'config' file to configure the skipping of all symbolic links while syncing.

### How to synchronise OneDrive Personal Shared Folders?
Folders shared with you can be synchronised by adding them to your OneDrive online. To do that, open your OneDrive account online, go to the Shared files list, right-click on the folder you want to synchronise, and then click on "Add to my OneDrive".

### How to synchronise OneDrive Business Shared Items (Files and Folders)?
Folders shared with you can be synchronised by adding them to your OneDrive online. To do that, open your OneDrive account online, go to the Shared files list, right-click on the folder you want to synchronise, and then click on "Add to my OneDrive".

Files shared with you can be synchronised using two methods:
1. Add a shortcut link to the file to your OneDrive folder online
2. Sync the actual file locally using the configuration option to sync OneDrive Business Shared Files.

Refer to [business-shared-items.md](business-shared-items.md) for further details.

### How to synchronise SharePoint / Office 365 Shared Libraries?
There are two methods to achieve this:
* SharePoint library can be directly added to your OneDrive online. To do that, open your OneDrive account online, go to the Shared files list, right-click on the SharePoint Library you want to synchronise, and then click on "Add to my OneDrive".
* Configure a separate application instance to only synchronise that specific SharePoint Library. Refer to [sharepoint-libraries.md](sharepoint-libraries.md) for configuration assistance.

### How to Create a Shareable Link?
In certain situations, you might want to generate a shareable file link and provide this link to other users for accessing a specific file.

To accomplish this, employ the following command:
```text
onedrive --create-share-link <path/to/file>
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, this access permissions for the file link will be read-only.

To make the shareable link a read-write link, execute the following command:
```text
onedrive --create-share-link <path/to/file> --with-editing-perms
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The order of the file path and option flag is crucial.

### How to Synchronise Both Personal and Business Accounts at once?
You need to set up separate instances of the application configuration for each account.

Refer to [advanced-usage.md](advanced-usage.md) for guidance on configuration.

### How to Synchronise Multiple SharePoint Libraries simultaneously?
For each SharePoint Library, configure a separate instance of the application configuration.

Refer to [advanced-usage.md](advanced-usage.md) for configuration instructions.

### How to Receive Real-time Changes from Microsoft OneDrive Service, instead of waiting for the next sync period?

Refer to [webhooks.md](webhooks.md) for configuration instructions.

### How to initiate the client as a background service?
There are a few ways to employ onedrive as a service:
* via init.d
* via systemd
* via runit

#### OneDrive service running as root user via init.d
```text
chkconfig onedrive on
service onedrive start
```
To view the logs, execute:
```text
tail -f /var/log/onedrive/<username>.onedrive.log
```
To alter the 'user' under which the client operates (typically root by default), manually modify the init.d service file and adjust `daemon --user root onedrive_service.sh` to match the correct user.

#### OneDrive service running as root user via systemd (Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSuSE, Fedora)
Initially, switch to the root user with `su - root`, then activate the systemd service:
```text
systemctl --user enable onedrive
systemctl --user start onedrive
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will execute the 'onedrive' process with a UID/GID of '0', which means any files or folders created will be owned by 'root'.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `systemctl --user` command is not applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS Linux platforms - see below.

To monitor the service's status, use the following:
```text
systemctl --user status onedrive.service
```

To observe the systemd application logs, use:
```text
journalctl --user-unit=onedrive -f
```

> [!TIP]
> For systemd to function correctly, it requires the presence of XDG environment variables. If you encounter the following error while enabling the systemd service:
> ```text
> Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory
> ```
> The most likely cause is missing XDG environment variables. To resolve this, add the following lines to `.bashrc` or another file executed upon user login:
> ```text
> export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/$UID"
> export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="unix:path=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/bus"
> ```
> 
> To apply this change, you must log out of all user accounts where it has been made.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On certain systems (e.g., Raspbian / Ubuntu / Debian on Raspberry Pi), the XDG fix above may not persist after system reboots. An alternative to starting the client via systemd as root is as follows:
> 1. Create a symbolic link from `/home/root/.config/onedrive` to `/root/.config/onedrive/`.
> 2. Establish a systemd service using the '@' service file: `systemctl enable onedrive@root.service`.
> 3. Start the root@service: `systemctl start onedrive@root.service`.
>
> This ensures that the service correctly restarts upon system reboot.

To examine the systemd application logs, run:
```text
journalctl --unit=onedrive@<username> -f
```

#### OneDrive service running as root user via systemd (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux)
```text
systemctl enable onedrive
systemctl start onedrive
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will execute the 'onedrive' process with a UID/GID of '0', meaning any files or folders created will be owned by 'root'.

To view the systemd application logs, execute:
```text
journalctl --unit=onedrive -f
```

#### OneDrive service running as a non-root user via systemd (All Linux Distributions)
In some instances, it is preferable to run the OneDrive client as a service without the 'root' user. Follow the instructions below to configure the service for your regular user login.

1. As the user who will run the service, launch the application in standalone mode, authorize it for use, and verify that synchronization is functioning as expected:
```text
onedrive --sync --verbose
```
2. After validating the application for your user, switch to the 'root' user, where <username> is your username from step 1 above.
```text
systemctl enable onedrive@<username>.service
systemctl start onedrive@<username>.service
```
3. To check the service's status for the user, use the following:
```text
systemctl status onedrive@<username>.service
```

To observe the systemd application logs, use:
```text
journalctl --unit=onedrive@<username> -f
```

#### OneDrive service running as a non-root user via systemd (with notifications enabled) (Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSuSE, Fedora)
In some scenarios, you may want to receive GUI notifications when using the client as a non-root user. In this case, follow these steps:

1. Log in via the graphical UI as the user you want to enable the service for.
2. Disable any `onedrive@` service files for your username, e.g.:
```text
sudo systemctl stop onedrive@alex.service
sudo systemctl disable onedrive@alex.service
```
3. Enable the service as follows:
```text
systemctl --user enable onedrive
systemctl --user start onedrive
```

To check the service's status for the user, use the following:
```text
systemctl --user status onedrive.service
```

To view the systemd application logs, execute:
```text
journalctl --user-unit=onedrive -f
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `systemctl --user` command is not applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS Linux platforms.

#### OneDrive service running as a non-root user via runit (antiX, Devuan, Artix, Void)

1. Create the following folder if it doesn't already exist: `/etc/sv/runsvdir-<username>`

  - where `<username>` is the `USER` targeted for the service
  - e.g., `# mkdir /etc/sv/runsvdir-nolan`

2. Create a file called `run` under the previously created folder with executable permissions

   - `# touch /etc/sv/runsvdir-<username>/run`
   - `# chmod 0755 /etc/sv/runsvdir-<username>/run`

3. Edit the `run` file with the following contents (permissions needed):

  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  export USER="<username>"
  export HOME="/home/<username>"

  groups="$(id -Gn "${USER}" | tr ' ' ':')"
  svdir="${HOME}/service"

  exec chpst -u "${USER}:${groups}" runsvdir "${svdir}"
  ```

  - Ensure you replace `<username>` with the `USER` set in step #1.

4. Enable the previously created folder as a service

  - `# ln -fs /etc/sv/runsvdir-<username> /var/service/`

5. Create a subfolder in the `USER`'s `HOME` directory to store the services (or symlinks)

   - `$ mkdir ~/service`

6. Create a subfolder specifically for OneDrive

  - `$ mkdir ~/service/onedrive/`

7. Create a file called `run` under the previously created folder with executable permissions

   - `$ touch ~/service/onedrive/run`
   - `$ chmod 0755 ~/service/onedrive/run`

8. Append the following contents to the `run` file

  ```sh
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  exec /usr/bin/onedrive --monitor
  ```

  - In some scenarios, the path to the `onedrive` binary may vary. You can obtain it by running `$ command -v onedrive`.

9. Reboot to apply the changes

10. Check the status of user-defined services

  - `$ sv status ~/service/*`

> [!NOTE]
> For additional details, you can refer to Void's documentation on [Per-User Services](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/services/user-services.html)

### How to start a user systemd service at boot without user login?
In some situations, it may be necessary for the systemd service to start without requiring your 'user' to log in.

To address this issue, you need to reconfigure your 'user' account so that the systemd services you've created launch without the need for you to log in to your system:
```text
loginctl enable-linger <your_user_name>
```

### How to access Microsoft OneDrive service through a proxy
If you have a requirement to run the client through a proxy, there are a couple of ways to achieve this:

#### Option 1: Use '.bashrc' to specify the proxy server details
Set proxy configuration in `~/.bashrc` to allow the 'onedrive' application to use a specific proxy server:
```text
# Set the HTTP proxy
export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:port"

# Set the HTTPS proxy
export https_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:port"
```

Once you've edited your `~/.bashrc` file, run the following command to apply the changes:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Option 2: Update the 'systemd' service file to include the proxy server details
If running as a systemd service, edit the applicable systemd service file to include the proxy configuration information:
```text
[Unit]
Description=OneDrive Client for Linux
Documentation=https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
........
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://your.proxy.server:port"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://your.proxy.server:port"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/onedrive --monitor
........

```
> [!NOTE]
> After modifying the service files, you will need to run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to ensure the service file changes are picked up. A restart of the OneDrive service will also be required to pick up the change to send the traffic via the proxy server

### How to set up SELinux for a sync folder outside of the home folder

If SELinux is enforced and the sync folder is outside of the home folder, as long as there is no policy for cloud file service providers, label the file system folder to `user_home_t`.
```text
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t user_home_t /path/to/onedriveSyncFolder
sudo restorecon -R -v /path/to/onedriveSyncFolder
```
To remove this change from SELinux and restore the default behaviour:
```text
sudo semanage fcontext -d /path/to/onedriveSyncFolder
sudo restorecon -R -v /path/to/onedriveSyncFolder
```
