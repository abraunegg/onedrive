# How to configure OneDrive SharePoint Shared Library sync
Syncing a OneDrive SharePoint library requires additional configuration for your 'onedrive' client:
1.  Login to OneDrive and under 'Shared Libraries' obtain the shared library name
2.  Query that shared library name using the client to obtain the required configuration details
3.  Create a unique local folder which will be the SharePoint Library 'root'
4.  Configure the client's config file with the required 'drive_id'
5.  Test the configuration using '--dry-run'
6.  Sync the SharePoint Library as required

## Listing available OneDrive SharePoint Libraries
1.  Login to the OneDrive web interface and determine which shared library you wish to configure the client for:
![shared_libraries](./images/SharedLibraries.jpg)

## Query that shared library name using the client to obtain the required configuration details
2.  Run the following command using the 'onedrive' client
```text
onedrive --get-O365-drive-id '<your library name>'
```
This will return something similar to the following:
```text
Configuration file successfully loaded
Configuring Global Azure AD Endpoints
Initializing the Synchronization Engine ...
Office 365 Library Name Query: <your library name>
SiteName: <your library name>
drive_id: b!6H_y8B...xU5
URL:      <your site URL>
```

## Configure the client's config file with the required 'drive_id' & 'sync_dir' options
3.  Create a new local folder to store the SharePoint Library data in
```text
mkdir ~/SharePoint_My_Library_Name
```

**Note:** Do not use spaces in the directory name, use '_' as a replacement

Update your 'onedrive' configuration file (`~/.config/onedrive/config`) with the following:
```text
sync_dir = "~/SharePoint_My_Library_Name"
```

4.  Once you have obtained the 'drive_id' above, add to your 'onedrive' configuration file (`~/.config/onedrive/config`) the following:
```text
drive_id = "insert the drive_id value from above here"
```
The OneDrive client will now be configured to sync this SharePoint shared library to your local system.

**Note:** After changing `drive_id`, you must perform a full re-synchronization by adding `--resync` to your existing command line.

## Test the configuration using '--dry-run'
5.  Test your new configuration using the `--dry-run` option to validate the the new configuration

## Sync the SharePoint Library as required
6.  Sync the SharePoint Library to your system with either `--synchronize` or `--monitor` operations
