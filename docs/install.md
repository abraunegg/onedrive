# Installing or Upgrading using Distribution Packages or Building the OneDrive Client for Linux from source

## Installing or Upgrading using Distribution Packages
This project has been packaged for the following Linux distributions as per below. The current client release is: [![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/abraunegg/onedrive)](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/releases)

Only the current release version or greater is supported. Earlier versions are not supported and should not be installed or used. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Distribution packages may be of an older release when compared to the latest release that is [available](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/releases). If any package version indicator below is 'red' for your distribution, it is recommended that you build from source. Do not install the software from the available distribution package. If a package is out of date, please contact the package maintainer for resolution.

This does not install a service. To install a service, use unstable channel (will stabilize in 20.09) and add `services.onedrive.enable=true` in `configuration.nix`. You can also add a custom package using the `services.onedrive.package` option (recommended since package lags upstream). Enabling the service installs a default package too (based on the channel). You can also add multiple onedrive accounts trivially, see [documentation](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/77734#issuecomment-575874225). |

## Building from Source - High Level Requirements
*   For successful compilation of this application, it's crucial that the build environment is equipped with a minimum of 1GB of memory and an additional 1GB of swap space.
*   Install the required distribution package dependencies coverering the required development tools and development libraries for curl and sqlite

## Compilation & Installation
### High Level Steps
1.  Install the platform dependencies for your Linux OS
2.  Activate your DMD or LDC compiler
3.  Clone the GitHub repository, run configure and make, then install
4.  Deactivate your DMD or LDC compiler

### Building using DMD Reference Compiler
Before cloning and compiling, if you have installed DMD via curl for your OS, you will need to activate DMD as per example below:
```text
Run `source ~/dlang/dmd-2.088.0/activate` in your shell to use dmd-2.088.0.
This will setup PATH, LIBRARY_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DMD, DC, and PS1.
Run `deactivate` later on to restore your environment.
```
Without performing this step, the compilation process will fail.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your DMD version, substitute `2.088.0` above with your DMD version that is installed.

```text
git clone https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
./configure
make clean; make;
sudo make install
```

### Build options
#### GUI Notification Support
GUI notification support can be enabled using the `configure` switch `--enable-notifications`.

#### systemd service directory customisation support
Systemd service files are installed in the appropriate directories on the system,
as provided by `pkg-config systemd` settings. If the need for overriding the
deduced path are necessary, the two options `--with-systemdsystemunitdir` (for
the Systemd system unit location), and `--with-systemduserunitdir` (for the
Systemd user unit location) can be specified. Passing in `no` to one of these
options disabled service file installation.

#### Additional Compiler Debug
By passing `--enable-debug` to the `configure` call, `onedrive` gets built with additional debug
information, useful (for example) to get `perf`-issued figures.

#### Shell Completion Support
By passing `--enable-completions` to the `configure` call, shell completion functions are
installed for `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`. The installation directories are determined
as far as possible automatically, but can be overridden by passing
`--with-bash-completion-dir=<DIR>`, `--with-zsh-completion-dir=<DIR>`, and
`--with-fish-completion-dir=<DIR>` to `configure`.

### Building using a different compiler (for example [LDC](https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC))
#### ARMHF Architecture (Raspbian) and ARM64 Architecture (Ubuntu 22.x / Debian 11 / Debian 12 / Raspbian)
> [!CAUTION]
> The minimum LDC compiler version required to compile this application is 1.18.0, which is not available for Debian Buster or distributions based on Debian Buster. You are advised to first upgrade your platform distribution to one that is based on Debian Bullseye (Debian 11) or later.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For successful compilation of this application, it's crucial that the build environment is equipped with a minimum of 1GB of memory and an additional 1GB of swap space. To verify your system's swap space availability, you can use the `swapon` command. Ensuring these requirements are met is vital for the application's compilation process.

> [!NOTE]
> The 'configure' step will detect the correct version of LDC to be used when compiling the client under ARMHF and ARM64 cpu architectures.

git clone https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
./configure; make clean; make;
sudo make install
```

## Upgrading the client
If you have installed the client from a distribution package, the client will be updated when the distribution package is updated by the package maintainer and will be updated to the new application version when you perform your package update.

If you have built the client from source, to upgrade your client, it is recommended that you first uninstall your existing 'onedrive' binary (see below), then re-install the client by re-cloning, re-compiling and re-installing the client again to install the new version.

> [!NOTE]
> Following the uninstall process will remove all client components including *all* systemd files, including any custom files created for specific access such as SharePoint Libraries.

You can optionally choose to not perform this uninstallation step, and simply re-install the client by re-cloning, re-compiling and re-installing the client again - however the risk here is that you end up with two onedrive client binaries on your system, and depending on your system search path preferences, this will determine which binary is used.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before performing any upgrade, it is highly recommended for you to stop any running systemd service if applicable to ensure that these services are restarted using the updated client version.

Post re-install, to confirm that you have the new version of the client installed, use `onedrive --version` to determine the client version that is now installed.

## Uninstalling the client
### Uninstalling the client if installed from distribution package
Follow your distribution documentation to uninstall the package that you installed

### Uninstalling the client if installed and built from source
From within your GitHub repository clone, perform the following to remove the 'onedrive' binary:
```text
sudo make uninstall
```

If you are not upgrading your client, to remove your application state and configuration, perform the following additional step:
```
rm -rf ~/.config/onedrive
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using the `--confdir option`, substitute `~/.config/onedrive` for the correct directory storing your client configuration.

If you want to just delete the application key, but keep the items database:
```text
rm -f ~/.config/onedrive/refresh_token
```
