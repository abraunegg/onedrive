A free Microsoft OneDrive Client which supports OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business, OneDrive for Office365 and SharePoint.

This powerful and highly configurable client can run on all major Linux distributions, FreeBSD, or as a Docker container. It supports one-way and two-way sync capabilities and securely connects to Microsoft OneDrive services.

This client is a 'fork' of the [skilion](https://github.com/skilion/onedrive) client which was abandoned in 2018.

*   Support for Windows 'On-Demand' functionality so file is only downloaded when accessed locally
*   A GUI for configuration management

## Reporting an Issue or Bug
If you encounter any bugs you can report them here on Github. Before filing an issue be sure to:

1.  Check the version of the application you are using `onedrive --version` and ensure that you are running either the latest [release](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/releases) or built from master.
2.  Fill in a new bug report using the [issue template](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
3.  Generate a debug log for support using the following [process](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/wiki/Generate-debug-log-for-support)
    *   If you are in *any* way concerned regarding the sensitivity of the data contained with in the verbose debug log file, create a new OneDrive account, configure the client to use that, use *dummy* data to simulate your environment and then replicate your original issue

4.  Upload the debug log to [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or archive and email to support@mynas.com.au
    *   If you are concerned regarding the sensitivity of your debug data, encrypt + password protect the archive file and provide the decryption password via an out-of-band (OOB) mechanism. Email support@mynas.com.au for an OOB method for the password to be sent.
    *   If you are still concerned, provide an NDA or confidentiality document to sign
