## Compilation & Installation
### Building using DMD Reference Compiler
Before cloning and compiling, if you have installed DMD via curl for your OS, you will need to activate DMD as per example below:
```text
Run `source ~/dlang/dmd-2.081.1/activate` in your shell to use dmd-2.081.1.
This will setup PATH, LIBRARY_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DMD, DC, and PS1.
Run `deactivate` later on to restore your environment.
```
Without performing this step, the compilation process will fail.

**Note:** Depending on your DMD version, substitute `2.081.1` above with your DMD version that is installed.

```text
git clone https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
make
sudo make install
```

### Build options

By passing `PKGCONFIG=1` to the `make` call, necessary libraries (`sqlite3`,
`curl`, and `libnotify` for notifications) are searched for using `pkg-config`
instead of using the hard-coded values.

By passing `NOTIFICATIONS=1` to the `make` call, notifications via
libnotify are enabled. If `pkg-config` is not used (see above), the necessary
libraries are `gmodule-2.0`, `glib-2.0`, and `notify`.

### Building using a different compiler (for example [LDC](https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC))
#### Debian - i386 / i686
```text
git clone https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
make DC=/usr/bin/ldmd2
sudo make install
```

#### ARMHF Architecture
```text
git clone https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
make DC=~/ldc2-1.11.0-linux-armhf/bin/ldmd2
sudo make install
```

#### ARM64 Architecture
```text
git clone https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive.git
cd onedrive
make DC=~/ldc2-1.11.0-linux-aarch64/bin/ldmd2
sudo make install
```

#### Docker onedrive monitor
```text
# Update onedriveDir with correct existing OneDrive directory path
onedriveDir="${HOME}/OneDrive"

firstRun='-d'
docker pull driveone/onedrive
docker inspect onedrive_conf > /dev/null || { docker volume create onedrive_conf; firstRun='-it'; }
docker inspect onedrive > /dev/null && docker rm -f onedrive
docker run $firstRun --restart unless-stopped --name onedrive -v onedrive_conf:/onedrive/conf -v "${onedriveDir}:/onedrive/data" driveone/onedrive
```

## Using the client
### Upgrading from 'skilion' client
The 'skilion' version contains a significant number of defect's in how the local sync state is managed. When upgrading from the 'skilion' version to this version, it is advisable to stop any service / onedrive process from running and then remove any `items.sqlite3` file from your configuration directory (`~/.config/onedrive/`) as this will force the creation of a new local cache file.

### Important - curl compatability
If your system utilises curl >= 7.62.0 you may need to use `--force-http-1.1` in order for the client to work correctly due to changes in curl to prefer HTTP/2 over HTTP/1.1 by default.

### First run :zap:
After installing the application you must run it at least once from the terminal to authorize it.

You will be asked to open a specific link using your web browser where you will have to login into your Microsoft Account and give the application the permission to access your files. After giving the permission, you will be redirected to a blank page. Copy the URI of the blank page into the application.

### Show your configuration
To validate your configuration the application will use, utilise the following:
```text
onedrive --display-config
```
This will display all the pertinent runtime interpretation of the options and configuration you are using. This is helpful to validate the client will perform the operations your asking without performing a sync. Example output is as follows:
```text
Config path                         = /home/alex/.config/onedrive
Config file found in config path    = false
Config option 'sync_dir'            = /home/alex/OneDrive
Config option 'skip_file'           = ~*
Config option 'skip_symlinks'       = false
Config option 'monitor_interval'    = 45
Config option 'log_dir'             = /var/log/onedrive/
Selective sync configured           = false
```

### Performing a sync
By default all files are downloaded in `~/OneDrive`. After authorizing the application, a sync of your data can be performed by running:
```text
onedrive --synchronize
```
This will synchronize files from your OneDrive account to your `~/OneDrive` local directory.

If you prefer to use your local files as stored in `~/OneDrive` as the 'source of truth' use the following sync command:
```text
onedrive --synchronize --local-first
```

### Performing a selective directory sync
In some cases it may be desirable to sync a single directory under ~/OneDrive without having to change your client configuration. To do this use the following command:
```text
onedrive --synchronize --single-directory '<dir_name>'
```

Example: If the full path is `~/OneDrive/mydir`, the command would be `onedrive --synchronize --single-directory 'mydir'`

### Performing a 'one-way' download sync
In some cases it may be desirable to 'download only' from OneDrive. To do this use the following command:
```text
onedrive --synchronize --download-only 
```

### Performing a 'one-way' upload sync
In some cases it may be desirable to 'upload only' to OneDrive. To do this use the following command:
```text
onedrive --synchronize --upload-only
```

### Increasing logging level
When running a sync it may be desirable to see additional information as to the progress and operation of the client. To do this, use the following command:
```text
onedrive --synchronize --verbose
```

### Client Activity Log
When running onedrive all actions can be logged to a separate log file. This can be enabled by using the `--enable-logging` flag. By default, log files will be written to `/var/log/onedrive/`

**Note:** You will need to ensure your user has the applicable permissions to write to this directory or the following warning will be printed:
```text
Unable to access /var/log/onedrive/
Please manually create '/var/log/onedrive/' and set appropriate permissions to allow write access
The requested client activity log will instead be located in the users home directory
```

All logfiles will be in the format of `%username%.onedrive.log`, where `%username%` represents the user who ran the client.

**Note:**
To use a different log directory rather than the default above, add the following as a configuration option to `~/.config/onedrive/config`:
```text
log_dir = "/path/to/location/"
```
Trailing slash required

An example of the log file is below:

### Notifications
If notification support is compiled in, the following events will trigger a notification within the display manager session:
*   Aborting a sync if .nosync file is found
*   Cannot create remote directory
*   Cannot upload file changes
*   Cannot delete remote file / folder
*   Cannot move remote file / folder

### Uninstall
```text
sudo make uninstall
# delete the application state
rm -rf ~/.config/onedrive
```
If you are using the `--confdir option`, substitute `~/.config/onedrive` above for that directory.

If you want to just delete the application key, but keep the items database:
```text
rm -f ~/.config/onedrive/refresh_token
```

## Additional Configuration
Additional configuration is optional.
If you want to change the defaults, you can copy and edit the included config file into your `~/.config/onedrive` directory:
```text
mkdir -p ~/.config/onedrive
cp ./config ~/.config/onedrive/config
nano ~/.config/onedrive/config
```
This file does not get created by default, and should only be created if you want to change the 'default' operational parameters.

Available options:
*   `sync_dir`: directory where the files will be synced
*   `skip_file`: any files or directories that match this pattern will be skipped during sync
*   `skip_symlinks`: any files or directories that are symlinked will be skipped during sync
*   `monitor_interval`: time interval in seconds by which the monitor process will process local and remote changes

### sync_dir
Example: `sync_dir="~/MyDirToSync"`

**Please Note:**
Proceed with caution here when changing the default sync dir from ~/OneDrive to ~/MyDirToSync

The issue here is around how the client stores the sync_dir path in the database. If the config file is missing, or you don't use the `--syncdir` parameter - what will happen is the client will default back to `~/OneDrive` and 'think' that either all your data has been deleted - thus delete the content on OneDrive, or will start downloading all data from OneDrive into the default location.

### skip_file
Example: `skip_file = ".*|~*|Desktop|Documents/OneNote*|Documents/IISExpress|Documents/SQL Server Management Studio|Documents/Visual Studio*|Documents/config.xlaunch|Documents/WindowsPowerShell"`

Patterns are case insensitive. `*` and `?` [wildcards characters](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490639.aspx) are supported. Use `|` to separate multiple patterns.

**Note:** after changing `skip_file`, you must perform a full re-synchronization by adding `--resync` to your existing command line - for example: `onedrive --synchronize --resync`

### skip_symlinks
Example: `skip_symlinks = "true"`

Setting this to `"true"` will skip all symlinks while syncing.

### monitor_interval
Example: `monitor_interval = "300"`

The monitor interval is defined as the wait time 'between' sync's when running in monitor mode. By default without configuration, the monitor_interval is set to 45 seconds. Setting this value to 300 will run the sync process every 5 minutes.

### Selective sync
Selective sync allows you to sync only specific files and directories.
To enable selective sync create a file named `sync_list` in `~/.config/onedrive`.
Each line of the file represents a relative path from your `sync_dir`. All files and directories not matching any line of the file will be skipped during all operations.
Here is an example of `sync_list`:
```text
Backup
Documents/latest_report.docx
Work/ProjectX
notes.txt
Blender
Cinema Soc
Codes
Textbooks
Year 2
```
**Note:** after changing the sync_list, you must perform a full re-synchronization by adding `--resync` to your existing command line - for example: `onedrive --synchronize --resync`

### Shared folders
Folders shared with you can be synced by adding them to your OneDrive. To do that open your Onedrive, go to the Shared files list, right click on the folder you want to sync and then click on "Add to my OneDrive".

### OneDrive service running as root user
There are two ways that onedrive can be used as a service
*   via init.d
*   via systemd

**Note:** If using the service files, you may need to increase the `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` value on your system to handle the number of files in the directory you are monitoring as the initial value may be too low.

**init.d**

```text
chkconfig onedrive on
service onedrive start
```
To see the logs run:
```text
tail -f /var/log/onedrive/<username>.onedrive.log
```
To change what 'user' the client runs under (by default root), manually edit the init.d service file and modify `daemon --user root onedrive_service.sh` for the correct user.

**systemd - Arch, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSuSE, Fedora**
```text
systemctl --user enable onedrive
systemctl --user start onedrive
```

To see the logs run:
```text
journalctl --user-unit onedrive -f
```

**systemd - Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux**
```text
systemctl enable onedrive
systemctl start onedrive
```

To see the logs run:
```text
journalctl onedrive -f
```

### OneDrive service running as a non-root user via systemd

In some cases it is desirable to run the OneDrive client as a service, but not running as the 'root' user. In this case, follow the directions below to configure the service for a non-root user.

1.  As the user, who will be running the service, run the application in standalone mode, authorize the application for use & validate that the synchronization is working as expected:
```text
onedrive --synchronize --verbose
```
2.  Once the application is validated and working for your user, as the 'root' user, where <username> is your username from step 1 above.
```text
systemctl enable onedrive@<username>.service
systemctl start onedrive@<username>.service
```

3.  To view the status of the service running for the user, use the following:
```text
systemctl status onedrive@username.service
```

### Using multiple OneDrive accounts
You can run multiple instances of the application by specifying a different config directory in order to handle multiple OneDrive accounts. For example, if you have a work and a personal account, you can run the onedrive command using the --confdir parameter. Here is an example:

```text
onedrive --synchronize --verbose --confdir="~/.config/onedrivePersonal" &
onedrive --synchronize --verbose --confdir="~/.config/onedriveWork" &
```
or 
```text
onedrive --monitor --verbose --confdir="~/.config/onedrivePersonal" &
onedrive --monitor --verbose --confdir="~/.config/onedriveWork" &
```

*   `--synchronize` does a one-time sync
*   `--monitor` keeps the application running and monitoring for changes both local and remote
*   `&` puts the application in background and leaves the terminal interactive

### Automatic syncing of both OneDrive accounts

In order to automatically start syncing your OneDrive accounts, you will need to create a service file for each account. From the `~/onedrive` folder:
```text
cp onedrive.service onedrive-work.service
```
And edit the line beginning with `ExecStart` so that the command mirrors the one you used above:
```text
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/onedrive --monitor --confdir="/path/to/config/dir"
```
Then you can safely run these commands:
```text
systemctl --user enable onedrive-work
systemctl --user start onedrive-work
```
Repeat these steps for each OneDrive account that you wish to use.

## Extra

### File naming
The files and directories in the synchronization directory must follow the [Windows naming conventions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247).
The application will attempt to handle instances where you have two files with the same name but different case. Where there is a namespace clash, the file name which clashes will not be synced. This is expected behavior and won't be fixed.
